#IfWinActive Cyberpunk 2077	; The first 2 lines set the script to work only within the game


; Holding Y performs a forward K-HOP and repeats jump to maintain momentum until released.
; The direction is only forwards - NO DIRECTION CHANGE with WASD - W is being pressed constantly!
; NOTE: You may need to tweak the LOOP valie depending on your Kereznikov item stats!
; WRONG LOOP VALUE WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE OF BAD TIMING!!!
; For the first "common kereznikov" the LOOP value starts at 40.
; For updated versions like "rare kereznikov" increase by 10 until it starts working.
; If you also equipped "nanorelays" increase more until it starts working.
; The longer the bullet-time stat in seconds, the more repeats are needed to sync the release.
; Longer bullet-time = increase value for more repeats or it will not work!
; If you don't intend to use bullet-time otherwise K-HOP is best with the "common Kereznikov".
